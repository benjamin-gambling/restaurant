# Restaurant Page 

This project was completed for The Odin Project JavaScript Restaurant Page Assignment. 

This is created using Vanilla JavaScript. 

The aim of the project was to create an basic Restaurant Page, built of modules for each component of the page. I used JavaScript alone to generate the entire contents of the website by using pure DOM manipulation  

In this porject we introduced NPM on the command line to install and use Webpack, along with JSON files for the webpacks config and also to store some of the 'restaurants' menu information.
